\usage{
harv_forw(stands_df, forw_size = "large", modelversion = "Talbot16")
}
\arguments{
\item{stands_df}{A data frame of stands for which harvester and forwarder
time consumption is to be estimated.
Mandatory variables in stands_df:
  v mean volume m3fub of the harvested trees in the stand
  Nharv Number of trees per hectare

 Optional variables, of which default values is set as first value:
  nbAssortments = 4; Number of qualities and species. Afect t7 ForwarderSortingTime
  treatment = one of "clearcutting"|"thinning"
  L = 2, slope class (1:5) where 5 is steep
  Y = 2, surface structure (1:5) where 5 is uneven
  D = 300, Terrain transport distance (one way average)}

\item{forw_size}{can be "small", "medium", "large"

Should also take "xl" and "xxl" but not yet implemented}

\item{modelversion}{one of "Brunberg" | "Talbot16"}
}
\value{
a data frame with harvester and forwarder time consumption (hrs hectare^-1)
